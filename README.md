# Survey Form: Greyhound Intake Form

[deployed on Surge](http://ihatetoast-greyhoundsurveyform.surge.sh/)

Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design Certification project

This survey has more details than the assignment's user stories required. I wanted a survey that I could imagine being used by greyhound adoption groups when they take in hounds from tracks/kennels, shelters, and owner-surrenders.
